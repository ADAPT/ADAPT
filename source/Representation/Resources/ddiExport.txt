DD Entity: 142 Physical Setpoint Time Latency
Definition: The Setpoint Value Latency Time is the time lapse between the moment of receival of a setpoint value command by the working set and the moment this setpoint value is physically applied on the device. That means if the setpoint value is communicated on the network (CAN bus) but the system needs 2 seconds to adjust the value physically on the desired unit (device element) then the Setpoint Latency Time is 2 seconds. 
The setpoint time latency value can only be positive.
Comment: The use of this DDE is to inform the overall system (e.g. Dektop Software, Task Controller) how the system works. The TC shall not shift this information into log files nor shall the device do that when sending actual values.

DD Entity: 143 Physical Actual Value Time Latency
Definition: The Actual Value Latency Time is the time lapse between the moment this actual value is physically applied on the device, and the moment that this actual value is communicated to the Task Controller. That means if the system needs 2 seconds to calculate or measure a value before communicating it on the network, then the Actual Latency Time value is 2 seconds.

Depending of the system characteristics the latency time could be negative or positive.

In case where the system communicates an actual value before the actual value has been physically applied the latency value should be positive.

In case where the system communicates an actual value after the actual value has been physically applied the latency value should be negative.
Comment: The use of this DDE is to inform the overall system (e.g. Dektop Software, Task Controller) how the system works. The TC shall not shift this information into log files nor shall the device do that when sending actual values.

Example for a positive value:

A seed flow sensor is placed at the start of the seed tube. At the moment the sensor measures seed flow X, it takes Y seconds for this flow to reach the coulters. The measured value is ahead of the physical value of the unit (coulters). So the latency could be plus 2 seconds.

Example for a negative value:

A flow sensor has a delay in its response to a flow change that means it takes Y seconds to realize the change. At the moment the sensor measures flow X, the flow is already present for Y seconds on the physical unit. The actual value is ahead of measured value. So the latency could be minus 2 seconds.

DD Entity: 158 Prescription Control State
Definition: Defines and synchronise the actual state of the prescription system. The state is represented by the lowest significant 2 bits in the lowest significant byte of the process data value: Byte 1: bit 0-1: 00 = manual/off, 01 = auto/on, 10 = error indicator, 11 = undefined/not installed. bits 2-7: reserved set to 0. Byte 2-4: reserved set to 0.

The DDI shall support the On Change trigger so that the TC is able to get informed when the value gets changed by the Working Set Master. The TC shall active this trigger when using the DDI.

See attachment for more information
Comment: The prescription control master and its clients need to be synchronized in terms of their general state or activation by the user (System activated/deactivated in individual setups). This DDE serves 2 purposes, one is to synchronize the prescription control state and the other is to enable a TC client to announce the support and initial state of its prescription control capabilities. Synchronisation by the prescription master (TC) is done by setting the prescription state of connected TC clients with a process data set value message with this DDE. It is recommended that TC clients reply their state immediately (within 250 ms) when such a message is received. The property flag "setable" and the trigger method "on change" shall be used with this DDE. The state "manual/off" indicates that the device is in manual state and will ignore all prescription commands. The "auto/on" state indicates that the client accepts the prescription commands as far as its overall process state allows.

DD Entity: 160 Section Control State
Definition: Specifies the actual state of section control. The value definitions are: Byte 1 (bitfield) Bit 0-1: 00 = manual/off, 01 = auto/on, 10 = error indicator, 11 = undefined/not installed. Bits 2-7: reserved, set to 0. Bytes 2-4: reserved, set to 0.

The DDI shall support the On Change trigger so that the TC is able to get informed when the value gets changed by the Working Set Master. The TC shall active this trigger when using the DDI.

See attachment for more information
Comment: In section control systems, the section control master and its clients need to be synchronized in terms of their general state or activation by the user (System activated/deactivated in individual setups). This DDE serves 2 purposes, one is to synchronize the section control state and the other is to enable a TC client to announce the support and initial state of its section control capabilities. Synchronisation by the section control master (TC) is done by setting the section control state of connected TC clients with a process data set value message with this DDE. It is recommended that TC clients reply their state immediately (within 250 ms) when such a message is received. The property flag "setable" and the trigger method "on change" should be used with this DDE. The state "manual/off" indicates that the device is in manual state and will ignore all control commands for section control. The "auto/on" state indicates that the client accepts the section control commands as far as its overall process state allows.

Listed below are 4 example Use Cases for this DDE:

Use case "Start up operation":
1. During a start up the implement shall set the SCS to ‘manual mode’.

Use case "Auto request from TC":
1. The implement receives an ‘auto’ request from TC.
2. The implement shall check whether all setup conditions are fulfilled to allow section control.
3. If this check is ok: The implement may respond with ‘auto mode’ and set its internal SCS client to ‘auto mode’.
4. If this check not ok: The implement shall respond with ‘manual mode’. The internal state is still in manual mode. The TC may inform the operator accordingly.  

Use case "Manual request from TC":
1. The implement receives a manual request from TC.
2. If the implement is still in ‘auto mode’ the implement shall set its internal SCS client to ‘manual mode’. 

Use case "Loss of requirements for auto mode":
1. The implement internal setup conditions don’t allow for automatic section control anymore.
2. The implement shall set the internal SCS client to ‘manual mode’.
3. The implement shall send the SCS to inform the TC accordingly. On reception of this ‘manual mode’ the TC/Section Control Master may inform the operator accordingly.

DD Entity: 161 Actual Condensed Work State (1-16)
Definition: Combination of the actual work states of individual sections or units (e.g. nozzles) number 1 to 16 into a single actual work state of their parent device element. The actual condensed work state contains the child element actual work states, in the driving direction from left to right, where the leftmost child element actual work state are the 2 lowest significant bits of the Process Data Value. Each child device elements actual work state is represented by 2 bits and defined as: 00 = disabled/off, 01 = enabled/on, 10 = error indicator, 11 = undefined/not installed. In total 16 child device element actual work states can be contained in one actual condensed work state of their parent device element. If less than 16 child device element actual work states are available, then the unused bits shall be set to value 11 (not installed). When the parent device element contains the Actual Condensed Work State DDE, then the device descriptor shall not contain the individual actual work state DDEs of the child device elements.
Comment: See attachment "ISO11783-11-DDI-289-SetpointWorkState" for implementation guidelines.

This DDE is used to reduce number of messages. Individual work state messages for a many-sectioned device can potentially cause performance issues due to overloading communication. With this DDE, 16 work states can be sent via a single message, resulting in less traffic to convey on/off status for an entire device.

DD Entity: 164 Actual Condensed Work State (49-64)
Definition: Combination of the actual work states of individual sections or units (e.g. nozzles) number 49 to 64 into a single actual work state of their parent device element. The actual condensed work state contains the child element actual work states, in the driving direction from left to right, where the leftmost child element actual work state are the 2 lowest significant bits of the Process Data Value. Each child device elements actual work state is represented by 2 bits and defined as: 00 = disabled/off, 01 = enabled/on, 10 = error indicator, 11 = undefined/not installed. In total 16 child device element actual work states can be contained in one actual condensed work state of their parent device element. If less than 16 child device element actual work states are available, then the unused bits shall be set to value 11 (not installed). When the parent device element contains the Actual Condensed Work State DDE, then the device descriptor shall not contain the individual actual work state DDEs of the child device elements.
Comment: See the DDI 161 attachment "ISO11783-11-DDI-289-SetpointWorkState" for implementation guidelines.

This DDE is used to reduce number of messages. Individual work state messages for a many-sectioned device can potentially cause performance issues due to overloading communication. With this DDE, 16 work states can be sent via a single message, resulting in less traffic to convey on/off status for an entire device.

With this DDE, 16 work states can be sent via a single message, resulting in less traffic to convey on/off status for an entire device.

DD Entity: 178 Element Type Instance
Definition: This DDI is used to enumerate and identify multiple device elements (DET) of the same type within one Device Description object pool. The value of this DDI is independent of the DET number. The combination of device element type and value of Element Type Instance ETI represents a unique object inside the device description object pool and therefore shall exist only once per object pool. Recommendation: The definition of the device elements should be made from left to right direction or from front to back direction.  When in a matrix, count left-to-right first, then front-to-back and at last top-to-bottom. See attachment for more information.
Comment: This DDE allows the system to communicate with a device element object independent of the device element number. The same tank of a seeder for instance could have various device element numbers based upon the DDD. The DDD structure may change during setup the implement. In this case a unique implement tank might has a different element number as before. Particular if the Task Controller (TC) use a user interface to display and change data by the operator. Therefore the TC needs clear or rather unique device element information. Assign this DDE for instance to a DET of type bin. This number can be displayed to the operator while it may be printed physically at the bin. The ETI number range from 0 to 65533 inside the object pool corresponds to a displayed value from 1 to 65534 on a user interface or physical device.

DD Entity: 179 Actual Cultural Practice
Definition: This DDI is used to define the current cultural practice which is performed by an individual device operation. For instance a planter/seeder could provide a sowing and a fertilizing operation at the same time.
 
The cultural practice value definitions are: 0=Unknown, 1=Fertilizing, 2=Sowing and Planting, 3=Crop Protection, 4=Tillage, 5=Baling, 6=Mowing, 7=Wrapping, 8=Harvesting, 9=Forage Harvesting, 10=Transport, 11=Swathing, 12-255=Reserved for future Assignment

See attachment for more information.
Comment: Implements as Planter or Seeder which provides more than one product application need an option to sign the cultural practice that is performed by each operation. More then ever if the applied products have the same unit type. As for instance a seeder provides a sowing and fertilizing operation which have both mass per area as unit defined. In this case it is not clear to the TC that the second operation is a fertilizing operation. Particular if the TC owns a user interface to display these information to the operator. Through this DDE the TC user interface can display the appropriate information. Adding this DDI to the device element of type device the main cultural practice of the device could be defined. For instance a baler will claim on the bus as forage device class and have set the actual cultural practice as baling.

DD Entity: 180 Device Reference Point (DRP) to Ground distance
Definition: This DDI is used to specify the distance from the Device Reference Point (DRP) down to the ground surface. The DRP to Ground DDI shall be attached only to the Device Element (DET) with element number zero.
Comment: Depending on the application it might be required to know the distance of a device element down to the ground. All device element offsets refer to the DRP which is the centre of the device coordinate system and usually not at the ground surface. For instance the DRP of a tractor is the centre of the rear axle. In this case the distance from a GPS receiver (DET of type navigation reference) attached on the roof of the cab is calculated through sum up the Z-offset of the DET and the distance of the DRP to ground. The value of the DRP in this case is equivalent to the radius of the rolling wheel which is attached on the tractor rear axle.

DD Entity: 205 SC Turn On Time
Definition: The Section Control Turn On Time defines the overall time lapse between the moment the TC sends a turn on section command to the working set and the moment this section is physically turned on and the product is applied.
The working set may support this DDE as an optional feature to provide the possibility to store the time settings direct on the device to make the settings available after a power cycle. Therefore this DDE needs always to be setable by the TC and shall not be used to change any working set system behavior. 

The DDI shall support the On Change trigger so that the TC is able to get informed when the value gets changed by the Working Set Master. The TC shall active this trigger when using the DDI.
Comment: The SC Turn On Time setting is used to compensate the average physical machine reaction time (Electrical & Mechanical) from the moment the Task Controller send the command and the Working Set applies the product. 
To find the right time setting for the used system combination of Task Controller and Working Set it could take awhile and therefore it is a big benefit to store the setting on the working set to make them again available after a power cycle. For working sets supporting Section Control it is recommended to add SC Turn On Time to its device description and make it setable. 
In case where the device description contains also Physical Setpoint Time Latency or Physical Actual Time Latency the TC Turn On Time will always supercede it.

DD Entity: 210 Sky conditions
Definition: This DDE is used to define the current sky conditions during operation. The METAR format and its abbrivations is used as follows to define the sky conditions:

CLR=Clear, NSC=Mostly Sunny, FEW=Partly Sunny, SCT=Partly cloud, BKN=Mostly cloudy, OVC=overcast/cloudy

1. Byte = first character
2. Byte = second character
3. Byte = third character
4. Byte = fourt character

Unused bytes shall be set to 0x20
Byte 1 to 4 set to 0x00 = error
Byte 1 to 4  set to 0xFF = not available
Comment: To setup the METAR abbrivations the IS0 8859-1 standard is used.
From the Latin-1 printable characters set the capitals from "A" (0x41) to "Z" (0x5A ) shall be used. The space "SP" (0x20) is used for unused bytes.

Example for Clear (CLR):
1. Byte = 0x43(C)
2. Byte = 0x4C(L)
3. Byte = 0x52 (R)
4. Byte = 0x20 (unused)

DD Entity: 215 Lifetime Working Hours
Definition: The number of working hours of a device element over its entire lifetime. This DDE value can not be set through the process data interface but can be requested and added to a datalog.
Comment: The recommended use of this DDE is to be transmitted on a request basis only.

The Lifetime Working Hours is the overall time when the device was turned on.

This total does not refer to an application controlled by a Task Controller. Therefore this DDE shall not be setable within the device description and neither shall the device reset the value when the task status changed. It is up to the device control system when to reset this value.

The Working Set Master shall support the total trigger method for this DDE but shall not support the setable property.

The Task Controller can request and store this DDE at the end of a task. But it shall not set this DDE when the task is resumed.

Note: unit is h and the bit resolution is 0.05 h/bit, this aligns the resolution and range with similar SPNs as defined in SAE J1939-71.

DD Entity: 261 Average Yield Mass Per Time
Definition: Average Yield expressed as mass per unit time, not corrected for the reference moisture percentage DDI 184. This value is the average for a Task and may be reported as a total.
Comment: This Average Yield Mass Per Time is the mass that includes the average crop moisture (DDI 262) if this is measured on e.g. harvesting equipment.  This average yield mass per time is calculated as the yield total mass (DDI 90) divided by the effective total time (DDI 119) of the active task.
When a task is resumed and its previously recorded totals are sent by the task controller to the connected working set, a situation can occur where there is a discrepancy between the yield total mass, the effective total time and the average yield mass per time values. In case all three of these DDI's are present in the device description and all three values are set by the task controller upon resuming a task, the working set shall compute its average yield mass per time from the yield total mass divided by the effective total time and shall discard the average yield mass per time value that it received from the task controller.

DD Entity: 262 Average Crop Moisture
Definition: Average Moisture of the harvested crop. This value is the average for a Task and may be reported as a total.
Comment: This is the average of the actual crop moisture (DDI 99) for the active task and is calculated as an average based upon the yield total mass (DDI 90).  In order to correctly calculate this value when a task is resumed, the yield total mass shall also be reported by the device as a total. When a task is resumed, the task controller sets both the yield total mass and the average crop moisture values. The device uses these values to derive the total moisture and calculate and report the new average crop moisture values for the resumed task.

DD Entity: 290 Setpoint Condensed Work State (1-16)
Definition: The Setpoint Condensed Work State DDIs are the control command counterparts to the Condensed Work States DDIs (161 – 176).

The value is a combination of the setpoint work states of individual sections or units (e.g. nozzles) number 1 to 16 into a single setpoint work state of their parent device element. The setpoint condensed work state contains the child element setpoint work states, in the driving direction from left to right, where the leftmost child element setpoint work state are the 2 lowest significant bits of the Process Data Value. Each child device elements setpoint work state is represented by 2 bits and defined as: 00 = disable/off, 01 = enable/on, 10 = error indicator, 11 = no change. In total 16 child device element setpoint work states can be contained in one setpoint condensed work state of their parent device element. If less than 16 child device element setpoint work states are available, then the unused bits shall be set to value 11 (no change). When the parent device element contains the Setpoint Condensed Work State DDE, then the device descriptor shall not contain the individual setpoint work state DDEs in the child device elements.

DD Entity: 304 Setpoint Condensed Work State (225-240)
Definition: The Setpoint Condensed Work State DDIs are the control command counterparts to the Condensed Work States DDIs (161 – 176).

The value is a combination of the setpoint work states of individual sections or units (e.g. nozzles) number 225 to 240 into a single setpoint work state of their parent device element. The setpoint condensed work state contains the child element setpoint work states, in the driving direction from left to right, where the leftmost child element setpoint work state are the 2 lowest significant bits of the Process Data Value. Each child device elements setpoint work state is represented by 2 bits and defined as: 00 = disable/off, 01 = enable/on, 10 = error indicator, 11 = no change. In total 16 child device element setpoint work states can be contained in one setpoint condensed work state of their parent device element. If less than 16 child device element setpoint work states are available, then the unused bits shall be set to value 11 (no change). When the parent device element contains the Setpoint Condensed Work State DDE, then the device descriptor shall not contain the individual setpoint work state DDEs in the child device elements.

Comment: See the Setpoint Work State DDI (289) attachment for backwards compatibility and implementation guidelines.

DD Entity: 367 Condensed Section Override State (1 – 16)
Definition: This DDE is used by the implement to communicate that a certain section is overridden and will not follow the section control commands. The value is a combination of the override states of individual sections number 1 to 16 into a single override state. The condensed section override state contains the child element override states, in the driving direction from left to right, where the leftmost child element override state are the 2 lowest significant bits of the Process Data Value. Each child device elements override state is represented by 2 bits and defined as: 00 = section is not overridden, 01 = section is overridden, 10 = reserved, 11 = undefined / not installed. In total 16 child device element override states can be contained in one condensed section override state. If less than 16 child device element override states are available, then the unused bits shall be set to value 11 (undefined / not installed). This DDE shall be placed in the same device element as the corresponding actual condensed work state.
Comment: It is common for SC servers to show the current state of the sections in a proprietary screen. As the implement is allowed to override the commanded state from the task controller it is impossible for the operator to predict what happens when driving into an unworked area. With this DDE it is possible for the SC server to show overridden sections in the proprietary screen.

This DDE shall be defined as DPD in the DDOP of the implement. The DPD shall at least support the datalog triggers “on change” and “time based”. The value shall only be sent by the implement if it was requested (single request or datalog trigger) by the TC-SC server.

DD Entity: 368 Condensed Section Override State (17–32) 
Definition: This DDE is used by the implement to communicate that a certain section is overridden and will not follow the section control commands. The value is a combination of the override states of individual sections number 17 to 32 into a single override state. The condensed section override state contains the child element override states, in the driving direction from left to right, where the leftmost child element override state are the 2 lowest significant bits of the Process Data Value. Each child device elements override state is represented by 2 bits and defined as: 00 = section is not overridden, 01 = section is overridden, 10 = reserved, 11 = undefined / not installed. In total 16 child device element override states can be contained in one condensed section override state. If less than 16 child device element override states are available, then the unused bits shall be set to value 11 (undefined / not installed). This DDE shall be placed in the same device element as the corresponding actual condensed work state.

DD Entity: 396 Setpoint Speed
Definition: The setpoint speed that can be specified in a process data variable for communication between farm management information systems and mobile implement control systems. The setpoint speed DDI may also be used in a device description object pool to specify support for speed control by a device. A positive value will represent forward direction and a negative value will represent reverse direction.
Comment: The implementation of speed control on the mobile implement control system may use other ISO11783 network parameter groups (e.g. ISO11783-7 Commanded Vehicle Speed and Machine Selected Speed Setpoint) and may be subject to control request authentication requirements. The definition of this DDI has been added to the ISO 11783-11 data dictionary to facilitate the specification of a setpoint speed in a task data transfer file and to enable specification of the support of speed control in a device description object pool.

DD Entity: 397 Actual Speed
Definition: The actual speed as measured on or used by a device for the execution of task based data, e.g. to convert a setpoint rate expressed per area to device specific control data that is expressed as a rate per time. The actual speed can be measured by the device itself or it can be a speed value that is obtained from one of the speed parameter groups that are broadcasted on the ISO11783 network and defined in ISO11783-7. Examples of broadcasted speed parameter groups are wheel based speed, ground based speed and machine selected speed. The source of the actual speed can be specified by a Speed Source DDI that is present in the same device element as the speed DDI.  A positive value will represent forward direction and a negative value will represent reverse direction.
Comment: This DDI has been added to the data dictionary to support logging of the speed that the device uses for processing and for generation of task data. The addition of a DDI for actual speed allows speed values to be added to the default data set that devices present to a task controller or a data logger.

DD Entity: 400 Speed Source
Definition: The Speed Source that the device uses to report actual speed and to process the setpoint, minimum and maximum speeds. The Speed Source value is an enumeration with the following definitions:
    0 = Unknown
    1 = Wheel-based speed
    2 = Ground-based speed
    3 = Navigation-based speed
    4 = Blended speed
    5 = Simulated speed
    6 = Machine Selected speed
    7 = Machine measured speed (This option indicates the machine uses an own sensor to measures the actual speed, instead of the speed provided on the bus).
    8 to 100 = Reserved
Comment: The Speed Source DDI can be used in conjunction with the Actual Speed DDI to specify which speed measurement method is used to determine the value reported via the Actual, Setpoint, Minimum and Maximum Speed DDIs. When a device receives commands for Setpoint, Minimum or Maximum Speed then the Speed Source can be used to select a ISO 11783-7 command for speed control.
